Description: |
  This workload was created to reproduce SERVER-21697 - Plan ranking should take query and index
  keys into consideration for breaking ties. First, it inserts 1000 documents 2 uniformly
  distributed fields, and creates indexes on both fields. Then it runs a pipeline, which will be
  slow due to incorrect plan selection.
