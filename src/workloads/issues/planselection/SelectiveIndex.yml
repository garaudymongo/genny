Description: |
  This workload was created to reproduce SERVER-20616 - Plan ranker sampling from the beginning of
  a query's execution can result in poor plan selection. First, it inserts 1000 documents 2
  uniformly distributed fields, and creates indexes on both fields. Then it runs a pipeline, which
  will be slow due to incorrect plan selection.
